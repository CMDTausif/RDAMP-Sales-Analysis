![List](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a15cb35d-b64d-43e8-9ffe-7048f540b886)

This analysis summarizes total sales, revenue, and average discount rates across different UK regions and product categories. The goal is to uncover regional performance trends and category profitability patterns.

**Key Insights:**

1. **East Midlands** dominates in revenue, especially in the Kitchen (£151k) and Outdoor (£144k) categories, making it the strongest performing region overall.

2. **The Kitchen category** consistently performs well across multiple regions, indicating strong and stable demand nationwide.

3. **The Electronics category** in East Midlands has the highest discount rate (18.66%), yet produces lower revenue than other categories—signaling potential over-discounting or weaker demand.

4. Other regions such as **Yorkshire & Humber, West Midlands, and South East** show significantly lower revenue, indicating untapped potential or regional sales gaps.

5. Discount rates across all regions typically range between 15%–17%, with higher discounting not always translating to higher revenue.

![List](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a15cb35d-b64d-43e8-9ffe-7048f540b886)

This analysis summarizes total sales, revenue, and average discount rates across different UK regions and product categories. The goal is to uncover regional performance trends and category profitability patterns.

**Key Insights:**

1. **East Midlands** dominates in revenue, especially in the Kitchen (£151k) and Outdoor (£144k) categories, making it the strongest performing region overall.

2. **The Kitchen category** consistently performs well across multiple regions, indicating strong and stable demand nationwide.

3. **The Electronics category** in East Midlands has the highest discount rate (18.66%), yet produces lower revenue than other categories—signaling potential over-discounting or weaker demand.

4. Other regions such as **Yorkshire & Humber, West Midlands, and South East** show significantly lower revenue, indicating untapped potential or regional sales gaps.

5. Discount rates across all regions typically range between 15%–17%, with higher discounting not always translating to higher revenue.

The two bar charts display the top 5 best-selling products by revenue and the bottom 5 underperforming products by revenue.

**Top 5 Best-Selling Products by Revenue:**

1. Portable Refrigerator Freezer is the top performer with a revenue of $51,380.05.

2. Portable Solar Generator follows closely with $51,174.07.

3. Electric Bike generated $47,708.27.

4. Compact Digital Camera brought in $33,252.43.

5. Compact Dishwasher rounds out the top 5 with $32,738.16.

The revenue figures for the top-selling products are substantial, all in the tens of thousands, indicating a strong market presence for these items.

**Bottom 5 Underperforming Products by Revenue:**

1. Herb Seasoned Rice has the highest revenue among the underperformers at $17.94.

2. Flavored Rice Cakes generated $17.88.

3. Canned Black Beans brought in $9.03.

4. Baking Soda yielded $8.77.

5. Cinnamon Raisin Bagels are the lowest performer with only $6.38 in revenue.

The revenue figures for the bottom 5 products are extremely low, all under $20, and some even under $10, highlighting a significant disparity compared to the best-selling products.

**Overall Analysis:**

There is a colossal difference in revenue between the best-selling products and the underperforming ones. The top products are generating revenues in the tens of thousands, while the bottom products are barely breaking double-digits. This suggests that the company's product portfolio has a highly successful segment and a segment that is performing very poorly. Strategies might need to be developed to either improve the performance of the bottom products or re-evaluate their presence in the product line.
